#Exitus
Originally starting out as just a project to learn ECMA6 by converting and updating a collection of scripts but now plan to continue developing it into a game.

The game will (eventually) be a strategic urban survival game in a procedurally generated city. 

Most changes are being pushed into the develop branch so make sure to look there for the latest workings.
